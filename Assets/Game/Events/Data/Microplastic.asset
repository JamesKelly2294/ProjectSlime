  Title: Big Problems With Microplastics
  FlavorText: 'Microplastics have infiltrated nearly every square inch of soil and
    ocean in the hundred years since they become part of the biosphere. In the mean
    time, cancer rates have shot up and impacts on human fertility have been noted.


    Task
    Force scientists have used genetic-engineering techniques to develop bacteria
    that literally digest the microplastics. These bacteria are very promising, but
    could pose a threat to existing plastic-based supply chains in the form of reduced
    functional life.'
  Responses:
  - FlavorText: Release the bacteria!
