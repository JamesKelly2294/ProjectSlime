  Title: Rising from a frozen grave...
  FlavorText: 'The last bits of permafrost have finally melted. Thousands of species
    of bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms have been released from their
    frozen tomb. New illnesses have started to pop up around the globe as displaced
    individuals encounter these microorganisms for the first time in thousands of
    years.


    Task Force scientists have proposed creating a task to research
    the permafrost microorganisms in a bid to prevent the next massive pandemic. '
