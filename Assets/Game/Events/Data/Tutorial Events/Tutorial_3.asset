  Title: Biodiversity and Sea Level
  FlavorText: 'Director -


    Your computer system is now tracking global biodiversity
    and sea levels. Keeping these metrics under control will be critical to ensuring
    the survival of humanity. <b>Once these values degrade they will not recover
    on their own - and the worse they get, the higher liklihood of disaster climate
    events.</b>


    We just need a bit more time, and the UCTF will be ready to
    act.'
