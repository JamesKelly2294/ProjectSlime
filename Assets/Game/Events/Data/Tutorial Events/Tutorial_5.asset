    The world is panicking at the news of the recent
    climate report and states are beginning to isolate themselves. Don''t expect
    any future help.


    Your computer system has been updated. <b>Select regions
    on the globe to fund and manage UCTF projects. Click and drag on the globe to
    rotate the camera.</b> This will be your primary means of responding to climate
    events.


    The UCTF is now ready to act. For all of humanity''s sake, don''t
    let us down.'
